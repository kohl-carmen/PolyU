Behaviour_Descriptives.m
	- reports descriptives (mean/sd rt/acc) for non-tms behavioural data
	- reports ttest betweeen MIP and MT non-tms
	- plots Figure 2 a,b

GLM1_all_nontms.m
	- applies GLM1 ({'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' 'D-HV' '(HV-LV)*(D-HV)'}) to non-tms behavioural data
	- tests each beta weight against zero and reports outcomes
	- plots Figure 2 c

GLM2_all_nontms.m
	- applies GLM2 ({'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' } step {'D-HV'}) to non-tms behavioural data (median split into easy and hard)
	- tests D-HV beta weight against zero and reports outcomes (once for easy/hard)
	- plots Figure 2 d

GLM3_Beh.m
	- applies GLM3 ({'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' 'D-HV' }) to behavioural data (tms x session x side)
	- reports GLM effects as well as ttests of beta weight against zero
	- plots Figure 3 a-d

Correlations_VBM.m
	- runs all correlations for voxel-based morphometry ouputs
	- reports correlation outputs in figure titles (outlier stats in cmd window)
	- plots Figure 4 b,c

Eyetracking_GLM.m
	- applies GLM (depending on 'Which_GLM' vaiable)
	- reports GLM outputs as well as ttests of beta weights against zero
	- plots Figure 5 a-d (depending on 'Which_criterion' variable) (for Figure 5 d, set 'Which_GLM' to 3)
	- plots Supplementary Figure S3 a-c (depending on 'Which_criterion' variable)

GLM5_all_nontms.m
	- applies GLM5 ({'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' 'D' '(HV-LV)*(D)' '(HV-LV)*(HV+LV)' '(HV+LV)*(D)', '(HV+LV)*(HV-LV)*(D)'}) to non-tms behavioural data
	- tests each beta weight against zero and reports outcomes
	- plots Figure S1 (Supplements)
	- applies GLM5 to median split (easy/hard) and reports beta weights against 0 as post hoc

 	- reports GLM effects (tms x session x side x AccvsRT ANOVA) 
 	- plots Supplementary Figure S3

Rev_NewGLM_divisive_norm.m
 	- applies GLM ({'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' 'D' '(HV+LV)(D)'}) to behavioural data (tms x session x side)
 	- reports GLM effects (tms x session x side ANOVA)
 	- plots Supplementary Figure S4

Rev_Multinomial_Regression.m
   	- runs multinomial logistic regression {'HV+LV' 'HV-LV' 'D-HV' '(HV-LV)*(D-HV)'}
	- reports ttests of each predictor's beta weights against zero
        - plots Supplementary Figure S2
